### Project Title
**Udacity Bike share**

### Description
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I have written code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. Also written a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
In this project, I have used data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/) which can be refereed from ([Chicago](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data) [New York City](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) [Washington](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data))
